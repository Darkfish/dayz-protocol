# dayz-protocol

Basic Python attempt at removing the packet encoding in DayZ. You will still need to process the DayZ/ARMA 2 packet structures to do anything useful.

Basic example provided for taking payload data off the wire from a router forwarding traffic of interest inside TZSP encapsulated packets.

I haven't played DayZ since approximately v0.52 so I can't confirm if this still works.
